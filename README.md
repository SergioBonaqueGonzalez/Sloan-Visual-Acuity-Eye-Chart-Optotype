# Sloan-Visual-Acuity-Eye-Chart-Optotype
This script generates an theoretically exact optotype based on Sloan letters, usefull for visual experiments.

It generates an optotype of random Sloan letters according to a variery of specified variables:
        - Distance from the eye to the optotype.
        - Pixel size of the screen (i.e. a LED screen) which will display the optotype (or pdi if it will be printed).
        - Dimensions in pixels of the screen.
        - Maximum lines of the optotype.
        YOU CAN MODIFIED THESE VARIABLES INTO THE SCRIPT, LINES 19-23.
        
        
As pixels number is a discrete value, only discrete values of visual acuities can be displayed accurately. Additionally, to display perfectly a Sloan letter, it has to be multiply of 5 in size. So, this script gives the nearest possible visual acuity values to the desired one.

It was written for my own experiments and works well for small displays. It there is any problem with bigger sizes, please contact me :-) .
